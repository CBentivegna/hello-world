# hello-world
This is my first foray into coding, so I am new to all of this. Don't steal my work, it isn't worth it.

So, seriously, I know nothing about coding and I'm taking a course to try and advance my career.
It serves you no purpose to steal or change anything I make.
Leave it alone.
The only reason I have made this is because my course requires it.

Bye
